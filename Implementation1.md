# Project Implementation 1

_Group 01 – PokéPicker\
Date and location: Jul 18, 2022\
Group Members: Saima Teasha, Ricardo Chairez, Mya Davis, Kyle Young_

## 1. Introduction

PokePicker is a web application where gamers can easily create and share their Pokemon teams without accessing the game. The system has four main software components which are, creating teams, viewing teams, deleting teams, and sharing teams. Creating a team allows the app user to select six pokemon out of the inventory database, choose specific battle moves for each Pokemon, and then save that team under a team name. Viewing teams on the web application prompts the system to retrieve all the user’s team as an overview. Deleting an existing team would look similar to viewing teams, except it will display a delete button and will ask the user to confirm their choice if they select to delete the team. The team will be removed and will not show in the web application any longer. To share a team, the user must select a team to share and the system will display all the shareable social media platforms. After the user selects one of the platforms, the system will redirect them to the associated link.

## 3. Adopted Technologies
- GitHub: we plan to launch our test prototype onto GitHub by providing a link. The team has also discussed the idea of opening an official webpage for the web application. All of our resources are uploaded onto the GitHub repository already. 
- VSCode: our IDE for implementing JavaScript. Most of the code is written and implemented in JavaScript with a couple JSON files. Our team came to an understanding that JavaScript would be best since most people already know it.
- JSON Pokemon Files: these database files for the Pokemon types are pulled from already existing JSON files found on Spirit. This information is used as the Pokedex. 
- Trello: the team uses Trello as a way of keeping track of our daily project tasks. All team members have access to this and can make changes, add activities, or comment on tasks when necessary 
- Firebase: team members with prior knowledge on this platform is the primary reason why we chose to use Firebase. The team has no prior knowledge of web applications using Firebase so we may switch to PHP and SQL for the database. 
- Discord: our main source of quick communication. If anyone has a quick question about their tasks and requires a solution, this is where they post them. This is also where we meet up every other day for our meeting minutes.

## 4. Learning/Training 

We are using three platforms for this project, Firebase, GitHub, and Trello. The team members were already well trained on using GitHub, so that was one problem that we all diverted. However, some of the members were not familiar with pull requests but the demo for PA1 helped all members get familiar with the concept. 

Some of our members have experience using Firebase and they are willing to take on the lead position for the project until everyone gets familiar with the platform. So far it has only been a couple of our members working on the programming while the rest just observe, but we want to have every team member participate in the programming at some point of the project. We have also talked about switching to PHP and SQL as a backup, but we will deal with that for the next implementation.

Trello is being used to keep everyone on the team accountable and upload a list of tasks which need to be completed every day. It has definitely refined our working method and our team has been efficient and on task. Trello is not a tool that we necessarily needed for this project, but it helps the team visualize every day tasks and deadlines. 

The team has been using Discord to communicate with each other and for our meeting minutes. It is a quick way to communicate an issue with the rest of the team and has been working great. All team members are very well acquainted with this platform and have been active any time a problem is asked.

GitHub has been our primary source of programming. It is where the repository lives and all our project documentation and files live. The team is on GitHub committing changes and creating JavaScript files almost every day. GitHub is our workspace where all of our presentables are located. 

## 5. Deployment
To deploy our system we are hosting it as a github page. Everything in which we have deployed so far is the ability to pick pokemon and make a team with 6 different pokemon types. Along with being able to navigate from the home page 

For our first implementation, we are deploying via GitHub pages. This is subject to change for our next implementation, as we might move the project to AWS.

## 6. Licensing

For our source code we are utilizing the MIT License, we chose this license because it allows everyone to use, modify, and even sell copies of the software. There is no reason for us to choose a more limited license because this license is simple and allows for people to do as they wish with our source code.
