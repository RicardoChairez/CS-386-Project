# Project Implementation 2

_Group 01 – PokéPicker\
Date and location: Jul 25, 2022\
Group Members: Saima Teasha, Ricardo Chairez, Mya Davis, Kyle Young_

## 1. Introduction

PokePicker is a web application where gamers can easily create and share their Pokemon teams without accessing the game. The system has four main software components which are, creating teams, viewing teams, deleting teams, and sharing teams. Creating a team allows the app user to select six pokemon out of the inventory database, choose specific battle moves for each Pokemon, and then save that team under a team name. Viewing teams on the web application prompts the system to retrieve all the user’s team as an overview. Deleting an existing team would look similar to viewing teams, except it will display a delete button and will ask the user to confirm their choice if they select to delete the team. The team will be removed and will not show in the web application any longer. To share a team, the user must select a team to share and the system will display all the shareable social media platforms. After the user selects one of the platforms, the system will redirect them to the associated link.
