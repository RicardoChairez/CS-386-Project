# PokePicker
We would like to create a web application in JavaScript/VSCode with Google Firebase as the database. We want to make a Pokemon team creator app that allows users to create a team name, select 6 Pokemon (from any generation) and save that team. The user would be able to view their teams, as well as teams made by other users.
